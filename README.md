## <p align="center">你好！(Hello)</p> <p align="center"> ⊹ ࣪ ˖Getting to know me:</p>
Ello!! Name's Slushy/Sys. You might've found me as a friend from Pony Town, roblox, group chats, or somewhere else! If you're just reading this, just so you know I am very obnoxious. I am overall really social and love talking to many people ^^. If I seem to be disrupting your peace, please tell me to stop talking. Although, I may be social; I don't talk a lot because I am basically bad at talking. Yes, bad at talking or just chatting. I will often try to include other people if they're left out! If I get too freaky, please remind me to stop if you feel uncomfortable with my actions. Anywaysss... I would love to make friends, yahhhh!! <sub>P.S. I am unable to feel any type of emotions, please exclude the awkwardness in my tone whenever I do VC one day. Tell me if I am being dry or not, so I can attempt to improve my reactions for better talk. Thanks.</sub> <p align="center">⤷ ゛More about me/summary: ˎˊ˗<br><br> Name: Slushy/Sys/Oofy(Reserved for close friends only!!)<br> Age: 14 (I'M A MINOR!!!!!)<br> Sexualities: Genderfluid, bisexual, & anvisgender<br>  Ethnicity: Chinese!(asian babeh)<br> Likes: I love owls- especially Eurasian Eagle-Owls, playing aggressive games, drawing fanart of many people, & making friends.<br> Dislikes: David bazucki, birth giver, and idk
